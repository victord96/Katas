## narcissistic_number
 A Narcissistic Number is a positive number which is the sum
 of its own digits, each raised to the power of the number
 of digits in a given base.
  In this Kata, we will restrict ourselves to decimal (base 10).
 Your code must return true or false (not 'true' and 'false')
 depending upon whether the given number is a Narcissistic number
 in base 10. This may be True and False in your language

## human_readable_time
Write a function, which takes a non-negative integer (seconds)
as input and returns the time in a human-readable format (HH:MM:SS)

HH = hours, padded to 2 digits, range: 00 - 99
MM = minutes, padded to 2 digits, range: 00 - 59
SS = seconds, padded to 2 digits, range: 00 - 59
The maximum time never exceeds 359999 (99:59:59)

## roman_numerals_decoder
 Create a function that takes a Roman numeral
 as its argument and returns its value as
 a numeric decimal integer. You don't need to
 validate the form of the Roman numeral.
